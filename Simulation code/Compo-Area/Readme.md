This code aims for simulating the Compo-Area samples.
Note: In this script, our code comments are not very detailed, please see the simulation code of Homo-Area for detailed comments. 
The main difference between Compo-Area code and Homo-Area code is to assign different properties to each sub-region.
The sub-regions in Compo-Area are similar to Homo-Area.
