This code aims for simulating the Compo-Area samples.

Note: In this script, our code comments are not very detailed, please see the simulation code of Homo-Area for detailed comments. 

The main difference between Compo-Area code and Homo-Area code is to assign different properties to each sub-region.

The sub-regions in Compo-Area are similar to Homo-Area.

The Jump transition is like the simple version of Layer pattern(the whole region combinded with two subregion), which is easy to be generated by adjusting the corresponding code.
